When you buy one, odds are good you’re getting another on the side; not two brands, but one selected manifestation of a single entity.</p>\n                <p>MSCHF X flattens the curation and purchase of two hands worth of individual brands into a single shirt. Simultaneously, through some applied hacksmanship, we remove these pieces from their pedestals - none have unique worth beyond the simple associative value of their logos.</p>\n                <p>What remains, when these decontextualized signifiers are stitched back into a pastiche canvas, is the platonic ideal of 2020 streetwear in its entirety. This is the last shirt you’ll ever need, and a snapshot of a scene in time.</p>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n    </div>\n}\n\nexport default Read;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AAEzB,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,uBAAuB;AAC3C,OAAOC,YAAY,MAAM,uCAAuC;AAChE,OAAOC,UAAU,MAAM,0CAA0C;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAEjE,SAASC,IAAIA,CAAA,EAAG;EACZ,oBAAOD,OAAA;IAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,MAAM;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACxBH,OAAA,CAACJ,OAAO;MAAAQ,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QAAG,eACXP,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,uBAAuB;MAAAC,QAAA,gBAClCH,OAAA;QAAKQ,KAAK,EAAE;UAACC,QAAQ,EAAE;QAAK;MAAE;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAAG,eACjCP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBAC/BH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAS;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAClBP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA2B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACpCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAwc;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAC/cP,OAAA;UAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;UAACQ,GAAG,EAAEb,YAAa;UAACc,GAAG,EAAC;QAAe;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAG;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACvE,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBAC/BH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA8V;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACrWP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAkB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAC3BP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAkB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAC3BP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA6L;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACpMP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAwB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACjCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA8G;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACrHP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA4B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACrCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA8F;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACrGP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA8B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACvCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA2I;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAChJ,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBAC/BH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAoB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAC7BP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA8B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACvCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAyE;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAChFP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA2B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACpCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA4F;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACnGP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA8B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACvCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAiF;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACxFP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAA8B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eACvCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAmK;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACxK,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBAC/BH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAmB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAK,eAC5BP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,GAAG,yBAAuB,eAAAH,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAS,iBACtB,eAAAP,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAS,mBACP,eAAAP,OAAA;YAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;YAAAC,UAAA;YAAAC,YAAA;UAAA,QAAS,gCACI;QAAA;UAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAChCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA4f;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACngBP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAmP;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAC1PP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA4I;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACjJ,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,eAC/BH,OAAA;UAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;UAACQ,GAAG,EAAEZ,UAAW;UAACa,GAAG,EAAC;QAAkB;UAAAP,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA;MAAG;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QAC9E,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,oBAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBAC/BH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAkN;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACzNP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAiX;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eACxXP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAmR;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI,eAC1RP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAoO;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,QAAI;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,QACzO;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,QACJ;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,QACJ;AACV;AAACK,EAAA,GAvDQX,IAAI;AAyDb,eAAeA,IAAI;AAAC,IAAAW,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
